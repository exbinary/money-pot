            In this moment of pandemic...
          </h3>
          <p>
          We have been horrified by the lack of a unified governmental response to care for
          the needs of DMV residents.
          </p>
          <p>
          This reality will only magnify the inequity in which we live every day, doing the most
          harm to people who already live at the margins of our social fabric: hourly and
          contract workers, people working in informal and gig economies, single parents, folks
          experiencing homelessness, poor and working class communities, immigrants with varying
          documentation statuses, people without access to health insurance, folks with disabilities
          or mental health struggles, queer and trans people, and Black, Brown and Indigenous communities.
          </p>
          <p>
          Here in the DMV, organizers from these communities are coming together to create systems
          of
          <a

            mutual aid

            for the survival and safety of their loved ones and neighbors...
          </p>
          <p>
          In the past week, mutual aid efforts have made sure hundreds of people who are confined to
          their homes get groceries, that there is a hotline in every ward for people to call who
          are in need of aid, and that there is a coordinated effort to hold the DC city
          government accountable to care for our neighbors.

              As with most community organizing work, setting up and implementing these systems

              individuals who already carry so much. We are asking you to pour into and support
              the work of folks leading mutual aid projects by giving generously now and for the
              future.

          As the pandemic drags out and highlights prevailing injustices, it is becoming clearer

            What is this 'money pot'?
          </h3>
          <p>
          Over the last year, members of the
          <span class="font-bold">DC Movement for Black Lives Coalition</span> have been
          growing a local, no strings attached fund. People with resources put in what they can each
          month and organizers can draw from the pot to meet their needs. Over the last 6 months,
          the money pot moved <span class="font-bold">$37,000</span> to local DMV organizers. In
          this critical moment, we are ramping up the money pot to cover local mutual-aid organizers
          who need financial support and encourage you to give big in this moment of crisis.

            Beyond this crisis...
          </h3>
          <p>
          Even when not in crisis, organizers are not paid for much of the work they do toward
          liberation. Many have to work multiple precarious jobs, rely on unstable grant funding,
          or waste time and energy staying afloat in other ways. They also tend to be incredibly
          generous people, sharing whatever resources they do have with their families and
          communities.
          </p>
          <p>
          We believe that sustaining the livelihood and work of local organizers is absolutely
          vital in our struggles for liberation. Please consider sustaining this work into the
          future by signing up to contribute monthly.
